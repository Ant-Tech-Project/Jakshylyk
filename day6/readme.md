## Git Hooks
>Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after specific events occur in the Git workflow. These hooks are customizable and allow developers to integrate custom scripts or actions into various points of the Git lifecycle. Git provides both client-side and server-side hooks.


- Git hooks are shell scripts found in the hidden .git/hooks directory of a Git repository.
- Git hooks are shell scripts that trigger when you perform a specific action in git, so they can help you automate your development lifecycle.
- You can trigger git hooks around specific git actions. You can set up a git hoot that prevents you from commiting if the hook scripts detects a problem.

### Purpose and Usage:

#### Preventing Commits with Syntax Errors:

- **Purpose:** Ensure that commits adhere to coding standards and have no syntax errors.
- **Usage:** Use a pre-commit hook to run syntax checks or code linting before allowing a commit.

#### Enforcing Commit Message Conventions:

- **Purpose:** Enforce a consistent format for commit messages.
- **Usage:** Implement a commit-msg hook to check whether commit messages meet specified conventions (e.g., proper format, issue references).

#### Running Automated Tests:

- **Purpose:** Run tests automatically before allowing code to be committed.
- **Usage:** Utilize a pre-commit or pre-push hook to trigger automated testing, ensuring that new code changes do not break existing functionality.

#### Preventing Unauthorized Commits:

- **Purpose:** Restrict commits to authorized personnel only.
- **Usage:** Implement a pre-commit or pre-receive hook to validate the identity of the committer against an access control list.

#### Auto-generating Documentation:

- **Purpose:** Automatically generate documentation whenever a change is made.
- **Usage:** Use a post-commit or post-receive hook to trigger the documentation generation process.

#### Integration with Continuous Integration (CI) Systems:

- **Purpose:** Trigger CI builds or deployments when changes are pushed.
- **Usage:** Configure post-receive or post-update hooks to notify CI systems about new changes, initiating automated build and deployment processes.

#### Customizing Workflow Hooks:

- **Purpose:** Tailor the Git workflow to specific team requirements.
- **Usage:** Create custom hooks to perform actions unique to the team's workflow, such as notifying team members of specific events.

#### Preventing Large Files or Sensitive Data:

- **Purpose:** Avoid committing large files or sensitive information.
- **Usage:** Implement pre-commit hooks to check for large files or sensitive data, preventing them from being added to the repository.
